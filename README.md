# Voice-Enabled-AI-Chatbot-for-Restaurant
To create a voice-enabled AI chatbot or virtual assistant for a fast-casual restaurant, you would need to integrate speech recognition (for taking orders), natural language processing (NLP) (for understanding the orders), and text-to-speech (for responding to the user).

Here's a simplified Python example using SpeechRecognition (for speech-to-text), OpenAI's GPT-4 (for processing the order), and pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech).
Overview of Steps:

    Speech Input: Use the microphone to capture customer orders in real-time.
    NLP Processing: Process the captured speech to understand the order using a pre-trained model.
    Order Confirmation: Confirm the order with the customer through voice and text feedback.
    Order Handling: You can integrate with your restaurant's backend or a mock-up to store the orders.

Prerequisites:

    SpeechRecognition library for speech-to-text.
    pyttsx3 for text-to-speech output.
    OpenAI GPT-4 or any language model for order processing (optional, but adds complexity and personalization).

Installation of Required Libraries:

pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 openai

Code Example:

import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3
import openai
import time

# Set up OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key_here"

# Initialize the text-to-speech engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Function for speech recognition
def listen_for_order():
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    mic = sr.Microphone()

    with mic as source:
        print("Listening for your order...")
        recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)

    try:
        print("Recognizing...")
        order = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print("Order received: ", order)
        return order
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        engine.say("Sorry, I couldn't understand that.")
        engine.runAndWait()
        return None
    except sr.RequestError:
        engine.say("Sorry, there was an error processing your request.")
        engine.runAndWait()
        return None

# Function to process the order using GPT-4 (or similar AI model)
def process_order_with_ai(order):
    try:
        # Sending the order to GPT-4 for processing
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="gpt-4",
            prompt=f"Customer has ordered: {order}. Confirm the order, check for common mistakes, and process it.",
            max_tokens=150
        )
        order_confirmation = response.choices[0].text.strip()
        return order_confirmation
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error with AI processing:", e)
        engine.say("Sorry, there was an issue processing your order.")
        engine.runAndWait()
        return "Error processing your order"

# Function to confirm the order with the customer
def confirm_order(confirmation_text):
    print(f"Confirming order: {confirmation_text}")
    engine.say(f"Your order is: {confirmation_text}")
    engine.runAndWait()

# Main function to run the chatbot
def main():
    while True:
        order = listen_for_order()
        
        if order:
            confirmation_text = process_order_with_ai(order)
            confirm_order(confirmation_text)
        
        # Ask if the customer wants to place another order or finish
        engine.say("Would you like to place another order?")
        engine.runAndWait()
        
        answer = listen_for_order()
        if answer and "no" in answer.lower():
            engine.say("Thank you for your order. Have a great day!")
            engine.runAndWait()
            break
        elif answer and "yes" in answer.lower():
            engine.say("Sure! Let me know your next order.")
            engine.runAndWait()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Explanation of the Code:

    Speech Recognition:
        We use the SpeechRecognition library to listen to the customer's order. It captures the order through the microphone and converts it to text.
        The listen_for_order() function listens to the audio, processes it into text, and returns it.

    Text Processing with OpenAI GPT:
        The captured order text is sent to GPT-4 (or another language model) using the openai.Completion.create() function.
        The AI model processes the order and generates a confirmation message or processes any changes or issues with the order.

    Text-to-Speech (pyttsx3):
        The pyttsx3 library is used to speak the confirmation or any other messages to the customer.
        The confirm_order() function will read out the order confirmation, ensuring the customer knows their order is being processed.

    Interaction Loop:
        After processing and confirming the order, the bot asks if the customer wants to place another order. If they answer "no," the chatbot will end the conversation; otherwise, it will prompt for a new order.

Possible Enhancements:

    Restaurant Menu Integration:
        You can integrate a restaurant menu to make the order recognition more effective and guide the customer with suggestions.

    Order Management:
        Once the order is confirmed, you could integrate this system with your restaurant's point-of-sale (POS) or order management system to store the order.

    Error Handling:
        Implement more robust error handling to manage noisy environments, unclear orders, and other user interaction issues.

    Voice Profiles:
        Implement different voice profiles (e.g., male/female voices) or a specific restaurant persona.

Testing the System:

    Run the script, and when prompted to speak, tell the assistant what you want to order.
    The bot will process the order using GPT-4 and confirm the order back to you using text-to-speech.
    You can ask for further orders or exit based on the responses.

Deployment Considerations:

    Cloud Deployment: You can deploy this system on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud, using services like Amazon Polly for text-to-speech and AWS Lambda for serverless execution.
    Mobile App: The system can also be integrated into a mobile app where customers can interact via voice to place orders.

This solution provides an interactive, voice-enabled chatbot that can efficiently handle customer orders while ensuring a user-friendly experience.
